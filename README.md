# Architectural Reconstruction

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **My main Jupyter Notebook file contains all the work done for architectural reconstruction: [reconstruction.ipynb](https://github.com/simonskodt/architectural-reconstruction/blob/main/reconstruction/reconstruction.ipynb)**

In this repository, I will ðŸŸ¡ **evaluate any architectural violations and recover the architectural module view** ðŸŸ¡ for the following open-source GitHub project:

- ðŸ”´ **[Zeeguu/API](https://github.com/zeeguu/api)**: API for tracking a learner's progress when reading materials in a foreign language and recommending further personalized exercises and readings.
- [Website](https://www.zeeguu.org/): Functionality and timeline.

I will do so by examining the implementation and reconstructing the as-implemented architecture -- recovering one or more architectural views. This is part of software reverse engineering where we obtain a documented architecture.

## Content

This repository will only consist of the scripts that I used for the reconstruction.
