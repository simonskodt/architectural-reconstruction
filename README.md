# Architectural Reconstruction

In this repo, I will evaluate any architectural violations in the following open-source GitHub project:

> **Zeeguu/API:** [Link](https://github.com/zeeguu/api)

I will do so by examining the implementation and reconstructing the as-implemented architecture -- recovering one or more architectural views. This is part of software reverse engineering where we obtain a documented architecture.

## Content

This repository will only consist of the scripts that I used for the reconstruction, as well as my time allocation in the project.
